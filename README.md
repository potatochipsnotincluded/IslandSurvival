# Island Survival
This is a survival game set on procedurally generated islands.

The `Scripts/` directory contains build scripts for Windows and Linux, and the `Vendor/` directory contains Premake binaries (currently version `5.0-beta2`).

## Getting Started
Open the `Scripts/` directory and run the appropriate `Setup` script to generate projects files. You can edit the setup scripts to change the type of project that is generated - out of the box they are set to Visual Studio 2022 for Windows and gmake2 for Linux.
